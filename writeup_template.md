# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted out of 9 steps. We are going to do the following procedures to identify and draw lanes on the video stream:

    * First of all we are going to convert the image to grayscale for easier manipulation
    * Next, we are going to apply gaussian blur to smoothen edges
    * Then applying canny edge detection to easier detection of the object by their shape
    * Define region of interest to limit area of lane identification
    * Perform a hough transformation to find lanes within our region of interest
    * Calculate the soap for the lines
    * Draw lines based on the coordinates received from the hough transformation
    * Draw the line on the edge image
    * Export the video


### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

Limitations of the following algorithm:

	1) It wonâ€™t work on curved lanes
	2) if the video has a vehicle hood in it, it will draw on the top of it.
	3) If the car is in front of our car it will draw lines on the top of it.
	4) little rocks and white paint on the road can make it looks funky


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

I would start with not relaying on the height of the image and fixing curve lanes, also check how the algorithm behaves when there is a car in front.
